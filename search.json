    "section": "How LIDAR works",
    "text": "How LIDAR works\nA LIDAR detector is flown overhead a terrain and short laser pulses are emitted towards the ground. The system then measures the distance to the surface that the laser targeted. Knowing the position of the senor and laser pulse direction the LIDAR can calculate the position of the object hit by the laser pulse. A 3D point cloud is then slowly built while the laser scans the terrain.\nSometimes, the laser pulse will hit a leaf. Other times, it will accidentally find an opening between leaves and reach the ground. The resulting point cloud then consists of the points that hit the ground surface and points that hit random leaves. By filtering points that are as high and as low as possible, we can then create two images: one including the foliage and one containing only the ground and solid objects."

    "text": "Where LIDAR shines\nFor OSM mappers, LIDAR is especially useful for discovering and aligning paths in woody areas. The image below looks like a well-mapped nature area with many criss-crossing paths.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootpaths and bike tracks form long troughs on forest beds and are clearly visible on LIDAR imagery. Notice below how many paths are misaligned or just missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther geo features that are clearly visible on LIDAR images are water bodies, streams, embankments and ditches.\nNot all countries have LIDAR data available. I have used Denmark as an example of excelent coverage. The source for the maps used is Styrelsen for Dataforsyning og Infrastruktur (SDFE aerial imagery, SDFE surface shadow map (40 cm) and SDFE terrain shadow map (40 cm)).\nI hope you can use this technique to improve OpenStreetMap. If you are not an OSM editor, you can still use the LIDAR imagery to discover hidden gems in your surrounding area."
